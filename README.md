# Numeric-sorting-algorithm
There are four programs in this project. All of them have the same objective 
that they random the numbers into the list ,and then sort the numbers from least to greatest.
Lastly, getting the time each porgram uses to execute sorting numbers and compare to themselves.

However, the difference between them is the algorithm used to sort numbers. There are four algorithm 
used in this projct including
1. Selection sort
2. Insertion sort
3. Merge sort
4. Quick sort
